Hexpert is a puzzle game based on optimization and thinking multiple moves in advance.

In Hexpert you must place buildings on a hex grid in order to gain score. In order to place a building
you need to fullfill it's placing requirements. For example, a house needs an adjacent farm in order
to be placed. Since every building needs to meet specific requirements, some valuable buildings are
much harder to place, but give a greater score reward!

Different tiles such as grass, water, sand and forest have different effects. For example, placing a
building on a forest tile doubles the score associated with that building!
