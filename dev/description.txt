Hexpert is a puzzle game based on optimization and thinking multiple moved in advance.

Hexpert is a hard challenging puzzle game that will work your brain in and out, twist it and stretch it.
Chess fans will adore Hexpert as it revolves thinking multiple steps in advance, thinking ahead
and planning to pull out really optimized placements.

In Hexpert you are required to place buildings on a hex-tiled map in order to complete the 30+ level it has to offer.
The difficulty comes as each building requires specific conditions to be met in order to be placed. An example of this
is that a house requires an adjacent farm. It gets a bit more complex when a Market requires a house, a wind turbine and a factory,
but the factory requires a house, a mine and a wind turbine.
