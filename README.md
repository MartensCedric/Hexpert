Hexpert is a puzzle based on optimization. You will need to think multiple moves in advance in order to construct buildings. Hexpert is for all ages and will work your brain a lot!

In Hexpert you are required to place buildings on a hexagonal tiled map.

8 different buildings, from a farm to a rocket! Four type of tiles with different properties : grass, water, sand and forest! 

Chess players and Minesweeper players usually love Hexpert because it requires you to work the same area of the brain.
